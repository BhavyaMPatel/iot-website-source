## MIT App Inventor IoT for Young People

# Welcome Students!

You may know that you can use MIT App Inventor to build cool mobile apps with your friends and classmates. And now with the Internet of Things extension to App Inventor (MIT App Inventor IoT) you can build apps that connect to things – physical or digital objects – in your world!

MIT App Inventor IoT needs an **external device to connect to and communicate with.** One of the most common devices used for developing for IoT is **Arduino (arduino.cc). Arduino lets you connect all kinds of sensors** (like sensors that can tell us the temperature, or how loud it is in a room) **and other inputs** (like buttons and switches) to an Arduino. We can then program the Arduino using App Inventor to allow us to **trigger other outputs connected to the Arduino** (like turning on a light, playing a sound, or moving a motor), **or send events to other devices like our smartphones!**
