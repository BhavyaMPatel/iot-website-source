## Getting Started with MIT App Inventor IoT

You are probably already familiar with how to build mobile apps with MIT App Inventor, but if you are new to this way
of building mobile apps we suggest you click here to become familiar with some basic functions in MIT App Inventor.

<b>Hardware</b><br>
To build Internet of Things (IoT) apps with MIT App Inventor, you will be working with external
hardware. You will need the following:

- [Arduino 101](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoard101) The Arduino 101 is a microcontroller and the first to be
included in theMIT App Inventor IoT release. Future releases will include other microcontrollers.
- [SEEED Grove Shield](http://www.seeedstudio.com/Base-Shield-V2-p-1378.html) that works with the Arduino 101 to easily
attach sensors and components.
- Sensors as need for specific apps or projects

<b>Setting up your computer (~ 30 minutes)</b><br>
You first need to install software and set up your computer to work with the Arduino 101 device. You can find a tutorial
on how to do this [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B51cwz24uqobMUJwNDVSeGNoQVk/view). You will then need to
connect MIT App Inventor to the Arduino 101 device and you can learn how to do that 
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B51cwz24uqobanJ2XzhLbGpQOFk/view).

<b>Start with a simple IoT app (~ 30 minutes)</b><br>
Before you begin with a full tutorial or a How To exercise, you may want to start with a simple app to turn an LED light 
on and off. [This Starter Tutorial]() will take about 30 minutes.

<b>Then try a How To sensor app</b><br>
Now that you have tried the Starter Tutorial, you may want to try connecting with different types of sensors and
components such as:

- Temperature sensor
- Button

Visit the [How To page](#/teachers/howtos) for a full list of sensor apps available in this MIT App Inventor IoT release.
