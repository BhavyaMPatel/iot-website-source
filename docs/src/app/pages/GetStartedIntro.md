# Get Started - App Inventor IoT
Connecting App Inventor with the Internet of Things can open up a whole new world of creativity and empowerment for you/your students. To get started however, there are a few more things you need to do to get set up. Below we'll walk you through everything you'll need.

## Microcontroller
To connect with the world of IoT you need a microcontroller. A microcontroller is a device that allows you to connect and control a whole range of inputs and outputs (sensors, motors, switches, etc.). Currently, App Inventor supports the Arduino and Micro:bit microcontrollers.

We are busy building tutorials for both microcontrollers. Currently, most of them focus on the Arduino platform. You can see them here.

Before building your IoT creations you need to set up your Arduino environment. Setting up your environment is pretty straightforward, start with the Arduino Setup doc.

Next, we need to learn how to build an App Inventor app that can connect to our Arduino. At present, we use Bluetooth to connect to our microcontrollers (we are working on WiFi). Building a basic app that can connect via bluetooth is also easy, you can follow this tutorial here, or you can download the App Inventor file directly here (although we suggest trying to build it yourself the first time).

## Some IoT Apps to Try
Now that you're up and running you're ready to start building Apps! We have a bunch in the tutorials section, but we suggest starting with the Light Sensor and RGB LCD Display tutorials
