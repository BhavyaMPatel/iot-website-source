## MIT App Inventor IoT for Educators

# Resources

Now with MIT App Inventor IoT your students can build apps to communicate with physical and digital objects in their everyday lives. Like all Internet of Things (IoT) applications, MIT App Inventor IoT blends computation with everyday objects. This area is growing rapidly with an estimated 16 billion IoT devices worldwide by 2021.

You probably already know that with MIT App Inventor you can engage your students intellectually and creatively while at the same time you can help them build powerful mobile apps that can make a real-world difference in their lives.

There are a few differences between a regular MIT App Inventor app and an MIT App Inventor IoT app. Probably the biggest difference is that **the IoT app needs an external device to connect to and communicate with.** One of the most common devices used for developing for IoT is **Arduino (arduino.cc) but there are other microcontroller devices on the market. Your students can connect all kinds of sensors** (like sensors that can tell us the temperature, or how loud it is in a room) **and other inputs** (like buttons and switches) to an Arduino. They can then program the Arduino using App Inventor to allow a **trigger to other outputs connected to the Arduino** (like turning on a light, playing a sound, or moving a motor), **or send events to other devices like our smartphones!**
