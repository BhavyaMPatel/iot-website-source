## MIT App Inventor IoT for Hobbyists

# Welcome Makers!

Today we are seeing digital devices embedded into our more and more everyday objects - not just our phones â€“ in the Internet of Things (IoT) space. By 2021, it is predicted that there will be 16 billion IoT devices in the world.

There are a few differences between a regular MIT App Inventor app and an MIT App Inventor IoT app. The biggest difference is that an **IoT app needs an external device to connect to and communicate with.** One of the most common devices used for developing for IoT is **Arduino (arduino.cc) but there are other microcontroller devices on the market. We can connect all kinds of sensors** (like sensors that can tell us the temperature, or how loud it is in a room) **and other inputs** (like buttons and switches) **to an Arduino.** We can then program the Arduino using App Inventor to allow us to **trigger other outputs connected to the Arduino** (like turning on a light, playing a sound, or moving a motor), **or send events to other devices like our smartphones!**
